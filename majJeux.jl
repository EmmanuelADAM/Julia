## code developped to build the heatmap figures
## that representes the results of the different choices of an agent or a human
## having to collaborate, according the state of its/his/her game partner
## figures used  to illustrate the behaviours of an agent (or a human) 
## Illustration used in the proposal
## "Matrices based on Descriptors for Analyzing the Interactions between Agents and Humans"
## Emmanuel Adam, Martial Razakatiana, ReneÃÅ Mandiau, and Christophe Kolski
## -------
## as it is a code just plan for a private usage to illustrate a part of the article and o other usage
## I apologize for the lack of commentary and its no pedagogical aspect
## Nevertheless, I tried to rewrite a most lisible code, at the expense of the efficiency
